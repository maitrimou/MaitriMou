### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Maitri, you can call me by my shortname Mou. 

<P>
**maitrimou/MaitriMou** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Nice to join Github Community to learn more about coding. 
I am currently passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community through my role as a It support specialist at Lightspeed Commerce.
